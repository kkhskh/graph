"""Minimal GraphHeal façade for unit-tests.

This lives in the *legacy* source tree (graph-heal/graph_heal/) that ends up
first on PYTHONPATH inside GitHub runners.  It purposefully implements only the
small subset of behaviour exercised by the current test-suite: a service
registry plus a couple of trivial helpers.
