Chunk,Summary
1,"Chunk 1: **User**  remmber what were doing?  --- **Cursor**  Based on the docker-compose.yml file I can see, we're working on a microservices architecture project called ""graph-heal"" that consists of several services:  1. User Service (service_a) - running on port 5001 2. Order Service (service_b) - running on port 5002 3. Inventory Service (servi"

8,"Chunk 8: **User**  tell me how to do this: Option 1: Run the Script from the Host (Recommended for Local Dev) Make sure the script does not try to create containers. It should only interact with the running services. The service URLs in your config should be localhost:5001, localhost:5002, etc  --- **Cursor**  You're encountering repeated errors when the test script tries to ""degrade"" `service_b`. The key issues in your logs are:  -"

10,"Chunk 10: **User**  okay do the steps that youa advised  --- **Cursor**  All containers (`service_a`, `service_b`, `service_c`, `service_d`, `monitoring`, and `prometheus`) are now properly attached to the `graph-heal_graph-heal-network`. This should resolve the service name resolution issues."
11,"Chunk 11: **User**  okay fix all of this Recommended Fix: Remove all containers and volumes, then recreate everything with Docker Compose only: This ensures all containers are created and networked by Compose, so DNS works as expected. Would you like me to perform a full cleanup (docker-compose down -v), prun **Cursor**  The cleanup and fresh deployment were successful! Here’s what was fixed and verified:  -"

Even though we added `iproute2` to the Dockerfile, it seems the `tc` command is still not available in the containers. This could be because:  1. The package might not be installed correctly 2.
